##### Gitman

http://live.gitman.ap

Foo is an application that makes the process of adding a reward to Github issues and sending the reward very easy. 
###### The process is as simple as:
- Add a bounty to a Github issue, the issue can be a new issue or you can sponsor an existing issue
- A developer completes the issue and submits a pull request
- Approve the pull request and the reward is sent to the developer who submitted the pull request
###### Below is a video of the app in action
###### Running the UI code
- npm run serve
###### Gitman API
We have also documented the API so others can consume it and create their own UI to facilitate the workflow.
####### Fees
At the moment Gitman takes a 3% fee when a bounty is added to an issue this is to cover the running costs and cover the cost of creating the required smart contracts    ####### Chat to us    We would love to chat to anyone about this project via the telegram link below
