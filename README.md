#### Gitman

> Complete Github issues and earn Ethereum.

Gitman is an application that makes the process of adding a reward to Github issues and sending the reward very easy.
 
##### The process is as simple as:
- Add a bounty to a Github issue, the issue can be a new issue or you can sponsor an existing issue
- A developer completes the issue and submits a pull request
- Approve the pull request and the reward is sent to the developer who submitted the pull request

Below is a link to the application:

##### Running the UI code

``` npm run serve ```

##### Gitman API

We have also documented the API so others can consume it and create their own UI to facilitate the workflow.

##### Fees

At the moment Gitman takes a 3% fee when a bounty is added to an issue this is to cover the running costs
